		<div class="container">
			<p>The objective of this project is the definition of an ontology about travels, especially envisioned for history and historians but not limited to it.<br>
			To define the ontology, first the core concepts of the ontology was defined; then the <a href="https://karlhammar.com/downloads/blomqvist2016engineering.pdf">eXtreme Design (XD)</a> process was followed (with the exception of the customer involvement part). This means that the design will be requirements-driven, test-driven and iterative. It will start from a series of stories, from which Competency Questions (CQs) will follow; the answers to this can be either Contextual Statements (CSs), inserting new constraints or notions to the ontology, or Reasoning Requirements (RRs), which one can get from inferences from known elements. This methodology also employs Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs), that are specialised for the ontology in use. <br>
			This ontology aims at describing historical events, thus should allow for maximum flexibility.</p></div>

			<p>Having described these core elements of the ontology, I proceeded to apply the XD methodology to further develop it.</p>
		<p>
			The explorer John Cabot travelled by boat under the commission of Henry VII of England. He explored North America, landing in Newfoundland, in multiple travels, in particular during his first travel he started in May 1497 from Bristol, landed in today's Newfoundland on June 24 1497 and returned to Bristol in August 1497. This travel can be inserted in the historical context of XV-XVI century colonisation of America. His objective was to arrive to the Indies.
