<h3 class="pub">JULY 20, 2021</h3>
<h3 class="pub">Updated at 1:45 p.m. ET on July 20, 2021.</h3>


<p>
<span class="place VH" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Horn,_Texas'>VAN HORN, Texas</span>—<span class="person bezosJ">Jeff Bezos</span> really flew to space.
</p>

<p>
This morning, <span class="person bezosJ">the richest person on <span class="place Earth" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_earth'>Earth</span></span> boarded a reusable rocket he dreamed up and funded, launched to the edge of space to experience a few minutes of weightlessness, and then came back down.
</p>

<p>
<span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> made the trip with three people who decided they trusted him enough with their lives: his brother, <span class="person bezosM" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Bezos'>Mark Bezos</span>; <span class="person funk" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Funk'>Wally Funk</span>, a storied aviator; and <span class="person daemen" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Daemen'>Oliver Daemen</span>, an 18-year-old fresh out of high school. Before today, <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>’s private space company, <span class="institution BO" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin'>Blue Origin</span>, had not flown its rocket with any people on board. By going first, <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> wanted to prove that his vehicle is safe, and that <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> is finally ready to make its 11-minute suborbital trips an experience people can buy.
</p>

<p>
The journey was lightning-fast by spaceflight standards. The <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> rocket rose into the sky with a rumble that echoed across the <span class="place TX" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas'>West Texas</span> desert, and about 11 minutes later, it was all over—the passenger capsule parachuted down, and the <span class="person bezosM bezosJ" source="#">Bezos brothers</span>, <span class="person funk">Funk</span>, and<span class="person daemen">Daemen</span> climbed out, grinning widely. The rocket was back on the launchpad, standing tall, after tearing through the atmosphere with a sonic boom. For this crew, <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> had made spaceflight feel almost as smooth as same-day shipping.
</p>

<p>
The passengers flew on a rocket called New Shepard, named for the astronaut <span class="person shepard" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shepard'>Alan Shepard</span>, the first American to reach space. They followed a similar trajectory as Shepard did in <span class="date 1961" value='1961'>1961</span>, but the <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> experience is thoroughly, well, <span class="institution Amazon">Amazon</span>-like. <span class="person shepard">Shepard</span>, a military pilot, spent months preparing to fly his <span class="institution NASA" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA'>NASA</span> capsule. Future <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> customers need only show up a few days before launch for some light training on their fully autonomous ride.
</p>

<p>
Most people know <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> primarily as the founder of <span class="institution Amazon">Amazon</span>—in the least flattering version, an ultra-wealthy boss who overworks his employees and hasn’t always paid his share of federal income taxes. But for <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>, space came first. He remembers watching Apollo 11’s <span class="place moon" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon'>moon</span> landing on his family’s television as a 5-year-old, and as a high-school valedictorian, he spoke about the importance of space travel. If <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> were anyone else, the story of his spaceflight, of a dream fulfilled, would be simple and sweet.
</p>

<p>
But if <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> were anyone else, he wouldn’t have been able to fulfill this dream at all. At a press conference after the launch, <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> thanked <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>'s engineers, and then added, <q class='quote'>I also want to thank every <span class="institution Amazon">Amazon</span> employee and every <span class="institution Amazon">Amazon</span> customer, ’cause you guys paid for all this.</q> Because of <span class="institution Amazon">Amazon</span>, he is the richest person on <span class="place Earth">Earth</span>, who controls the daily life of so many others here—not just his employees, but the hundreds of millions of us who partake, sometimes grudgingly, in the products he owns. <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> benefits when we buy things (<span class="institution Amazon">Amazon</span>), eat (<span class="institution wholefoods" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market'>Whole Foods</span>), read movie trivia (<span class="institution IMDb" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb'>IMDb</span>), rate books (<span class="institution goodreads" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodreads'>Goodreads</span>), manage our homes (<span class="institution alexa" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa'>Alexa</span>), catch up on the news (<span class="institution washingtonpost" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post'>The Washington Post</span>), and go online (<span class="institution Amazon">Amazon</span> Web Services). We live in the world <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> built. In that sense, as he floated over the <span class="place Earth">Earth</span>, taking in the beautiful view, he was surveying his kingdom, and adding one more dimension to his realm.
</p>

<p>
<span class="person branson" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson'>Richard Branson</span> may have beaten <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> to space, but <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> is working on an even bigger rocket that could fly people and payloads well beyond the edge of space, into orbit around <span class="place Earth">Earth</span>. It’s also developing, with the help of a couple of longtime <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span> contractors, technology to return American astronauts to the surface of the <span class="place moon">moon</span>, by the <span class="date 2024" value='2024'>2024</span> deadline that <span class="person trump" source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</span> set and that <span class="person biden" source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden">Joe Biden</span> has so far kept. <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span> originally chose <span class="person musk" source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</span>’s <span class="institution spaceX"  source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX'>SpaceX</span> for this job, but while <span class="person musk">Musk</span> joked about the situation—tweeting that <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> <q class='quote'>can’t get it up (to orbit) lol</q>—<span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> directed his staff to formally contest the space agency’s decision. <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>’s contract is now on hold.
</p>

<p>
For <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>, today’s flight wasn’t just a joyride. The space billionaire still has more to prove. As a businessman, he already has a comfortable hold on the American way of life. As a spaceman, he wants a hold on its way of life among the stars.
</p>

<p>
The day before he flew to space, <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> walked around his facility in the <span class="place TX">West Texas</span> desert, dressed for the part of a cowboy. Big hat, shiny belt buckle, pointed boots—a very different man from tech-scion <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>, in his puffer vest and aviator sunglasses. He remains buff, the result of an exercise regimen that, according to one of his friends, he took up several years ago so that he could be in good shape for spaceflight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> spent the summers of his childhood and early teenage years on his grandfather’s ranch in <span class="place TX">South Texas</span>, fixing windmills, helping castrate cattle, and working his way through the science-fiction collection of the local library, as the journalist <span class="person davenport" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Davenport'>Christian Davenport</span> recounts in The Space Barons, a book about <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> and the other space billionaires. In college, <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> was the president of a spaceflight club and attended lectures by <span class="person oNeill" source='#'>Gerard O’Neill</span>, the physicist who dreamed of space stations kept in perpetual motion to produce artificial gravity. <q class='quote'>It’s always the science-fiction guys,</q> <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> later said, according to <span class="person davenport">Davenport</span>. <q class='quote'>They think of everything first, and then the builders come along and make it happen.</q>
</p>

<p>
It helps, of course, when the builders are billionaires. <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> founded <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>—named for the pale blue dot where humankind arose—in <span class="date 2000" value='2000'>2000</span>. He was already extraordinarily rich, and he had little trouble buying up land in <span class="place TX">West Texas</span> to start developing rocket technology in secret. When the company <span class="event NSlaunch" source="#">successfully launched its New Shepard rocket for the first time, in <span class="date 2015" value='2015'>2015</span></span>, it announced the news a day later, through a carefully curated press release. <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> was not in a rush back then; <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>’s mascot is a tortoise, and for years <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>, who would devote one day of his workweek to <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>, was content to move slowly and let the hare in the industry, <span class="person musk">Musk</span>, run loose. Occasionally they tussled. After <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> launched a rocket and then landed it upright—a historic first in the rocket business—<span class="person musk">Musk</span> praised <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>, but made sure to point out that <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> had reached only the edge of space, not orbit. When <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> achieved the same feat with an orbital rocket a month later, <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> playfully ignored the distinction, congratulating <span class="person musk">Musk</span> with a <q class='quote'>Welcome to the club!</q> <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> remained unperturbed as <span class="person musk">Musk</span> raced ahead—until this year, when that <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span> <span class="place moon">moon</span> contract swung out of reach, and something shifted.
</p>

<p>
Now <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> has made an effort to draw people into <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>’s space world. The day before the launch, the usually press-averse <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> gave interviews to the major TV networks while dressed in his cobalt-blue flight suit, with his fellow passengers at his side. Hours before the flight, in the middle of the night, dozens of reporters gathered at the <span class="place VH">Van Horn Community Center</span> to board shuttles to <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>’s remote facility north of town. Signs of the space company’s presence are sprinkled around <span class="place VH">Van Horn</span>—a banner stuck to the Cactus Cantina restaurant on the main drag, a mural of the <span class="person bezosM bezosJ">Bezos brothers</span> painted on the side of an abandoned storefront. The locals speak of the <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> site as if it were a mystical place, shrouded in a force field few can penetrate. It is certainly no <span class="place FL" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida'>Cape Canaveral</span>; a safety briefing for reporters warned of the myriad dangers of the remote site, from hazardous materials to wild hogs. As the press bus drove out of the community-center parking lot and into the darkness, I realized that I had flown nearly 2,000 miles and driven 115 miles to get here, but I had no idea where <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> was taking me. It felt like being invited to a reclusive, eccentric person’s home for dinner, only the host was going to launch into space during the main course.
</p>

<p>
<span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>’s entire endeavor, historic as it might be, seems to some people like pure excess, the whim of a leader who has lost touch with the average person’s sense of the world. Even some of <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>’s employees have had concerns; in <span class="event pandemic" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covid19_pandemic'><span class="date april-2020" value='2020-04'>April 2020</span>, as the coronavirus swept across the <span class="place US" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America'>United States</span></span>, <span class="institution verge" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge'>The Verge</span>’s <span class="person grush" source='#'>Loren Grush</span> reported that some workers felt that managers were pressuring them to keep up the pace, prioritizing the development of New Shepard over their health and safety.
</p>

<p>
As the day of <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>’s flight drew closer, critics asked him to read the room, to pay more attention to <span class="place Earth">Earth</span> and spend money on problems closer to home. <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> did—a bit, by billionaire standards—donating $19 million from <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>’s coffers to space-related organizations, and $200 million of his own fortune to the <span class="institution SNASM" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Air_and_Space_Museum'>Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum</span>. After his flight, <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> announced more giveaways—$100 million each to the news anchor <span class="person jones" source="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jones">Van Jones</span> and the chef <span class="person andres" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Andr%C3%A9s'>José Andrés</span>, who both run nonprofit organizations, to distribute to whatever charities they like.
</p>

<p>
The criticism of space travel as frivolous is as old as the act itself; in the golden age of <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span>, the ire was directed at a government deemed neglectful of its constituents; in the gilded age of private space tourism, it is aimed at billionaires seen as frivolous. But paying attention to <span class="place Earth">Earth</span> and looking toward the stars are not contradictory acts, nor does one come at the detriment of the other. As <span class="person predscod" source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanda_Prescod-Weinstein">Chanda Prescod-Weinstein</span>, a theoretical physicist at the <span class="institution UNH" source='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire'>University of New Hampshire</span>, recently wrote in a Washington Post op-ed, <q class='quote'>We don’t actually face a choice between basic human needs and exciting journeys into the universe.</q> While <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span> has some responsibility to get the public’s buy-in for its missions beyond <span class="place Earth">Earth</span>, the space billionaires don’t. They can try, as <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> and <span class="person branson">Branson</span> have done, but the sell is harder when part of their motivation is so obviously personal.
</p>

<p>
For <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> in particular, selling the value of such a journey is a different challenge from any other he has attempted. People might not like how he runs <span class="institution Amazon">Amazon</span>, but they need toilet paper, or scissors, or a book, or some other mundane item that the company can provide, faster and with greater customer ease than anyone else. <span class="institution Amazon">Amazon</span> and <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>’s other companies have population-size customer bases; <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>, given the cost of a ticket—which remains under wraps, but is rumored to be several hundred thousand dollars—will have far fewer customers, at least in <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span>’s lifetime. No one needs to go to space right now.
</p>

<p>
But <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> believes humankind will need to soon—not just the elites who can afford <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>’s services, but all kinds of people. The space-nerd valedictorian told his classmates that people should move to space in order to preserve the <span class="place Earth">Earth</span>, and as an adult he still believes that. Of the space billionaires, <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> is perhaps the most nostalgic. He has named his rockets after the spacefarers of <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span>’s early years, and scheduled his spaceflight for <span class="event anniversary" z>the anniversary of the first <span class="place moon">moon</span> landing</span>. <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> once organized a secret, expensive expedition to scour the seafloor off the coast of <span class="place FL">Florida</span> in search of the discarded engines from the gargantuan rocket that lofted the Apollo 11 astronauts toward the <span class="place moon">moon</span>. When the hardware was hauled onto the ship, <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> was on deck, wiping the salty mud off the wreck like it was treasure.
</p>

<p>
<span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> has made himself a significant character in the story of American spaceflight, intertwining his achievements with those of spacefarers past. <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> did today what someone else accomplished 60 years ago, but what he can do next, now that he’s back on <span class="place Earth">Earth</span>, sets his achievement apart. Given an opening for business, <span class="person bezosJ">Bezos</span> will exploit it to its most ambitious, sprawling end. There, at the edge of space, what possibilities did he see?
