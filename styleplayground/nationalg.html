<p>
<span class="place southpadre">SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, <span class="place texas">TEXAS</span></span> - The engines ignited with a burst of fiery exhaust, kicking up a bloom of brown dust, as the 165-foot-tall rocket, known as Serial Number 8 (SN8), made its way into the blue sky over <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Beach, outside <span class="place brownsville">Brownsville</span>, <span class="place texas">Texas</span></span>. The prototype seemed to stagger under its 110-ton weight, despite a trio of engines—each producing half a million pounds of thrust—propelling it through the air.
</p>

<p>
SN8 rose to about 41,000 feet—higher than domestic airliners fly—before shutting off its engines and turning horizontally, as planned. While freefalling, the powered fins kept the craft oriented on its belly, looking more like a dirigible balloon than a spacecraft as it descended toward its landing pad. With a surprisingly graceful motion, the prototype flipped back to a vertical position with the reignition of two of its engines, and in a green-white blaze of exhaust came in for a retrorocket landing worthy of Flash Gordon.
</p>

<img src="assets/NG2.png" style="height:500px; width:auto;">


<p>
Then its legs hit the ground, and SN8 exploded in a roiling fireball. When the smoke cleared, all that was left of the rocket was a charred and misshapen nose cone resting on the landing pad.
</p>

<p>
There’s a reason these born-to-die testbeds are given dispassionate serial numbers instead of names. The new spaceship’s flight plan was so risky that <span class="person musk">Elon Musk</span>, the iconoclastic billionaire founder of <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>, had openly predicted that SN8 <q class="quote">probably isn’t going to make it.</q>
</p>

<p>
For a prototype like SN8, part of a test program to develop a new rocket called Starship, success is not defined by survival but by the amount of data generated during flight. The longer the flight and the more maneuvers attempted, the better.
</p>

<p>
With its sharp nose, tail fins, and metallic sheen, Starship’s design seems ripped from a 1950s sci-fi paperback. Its stated purpose doesn’t spoil the illusion. <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> envisions a behemoth spacecraft designed to carry 100 tons, including up to 100 people, into space and land anywhere on <span calss="place earth">Earth</span>, the <span calss="place moon">moon</span>, or <span calss="place mars">Mars</span>.
</p>

<p>
This week’s explosive flight test is a pivotal first step toward what <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> and other space flight experts hope will accelerate humanity’s push into the cosmos. <q class="quote">Starship will be a game changer, period,</q> says <span calss="person forczyk">Laura Forczyk</span>, an industry consultant and <span calss="institution nasa">NASA</span> expert for planetary science missions. <q class="quote">If successful as currently envisioned, it will be able to carry more people into space with one launch than the total number of people launched into space per year now.</q>
</p>

<p>
To pursue this vision, <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> is transforming a quiet stretch of <span class="place texas">South Texas</span> beach into a factory and test site for the largest launch system ever built. It hasn’t been entirely smooth sailing. The company bought out most of the homes in a local community amid bitter feelings from the homeowners, and environmentalists are increasingly worried that the massive rockets that <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> is building will disrupt wildlife on the once sleepy shoreline.
</p>

</video> -->

<p>
The company is not taking media interviewss about Starship, <q class="quote">but instead trying to keep the team focused on mission-critical tasks,</q> said <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> spokesman <span class="person gleeson">James Gleeson</span>.
</p>

<p>
After the flight, however, <span class="person musk">Musk</span> took to <span class="institution twitter">Twitter</span>, elated that the test generated the data they had hoped for. During the last moments of the flight, he explained, low pressure in a liquid oxygen tank sapped the engines of enough power to slow SN8 for a successful touchdown. What followed was an RUD, or rapid unexpected disassembly—<span class="person musk">Musk</span>-speak for an explosive crash.
</p>

<p>
<q class="quote">Putting the crater in the right spot was epic,</q> he added.
</p>

<p>
<h2>A spaceship to settle <span calss="place mars">Mars</span></h2>
The scale of the Starship project is nakedly futuristic: a massive, reusable spacecraft with the ability to land on multiple worlds. <q class="quote">Starship would be able to lift heavier spacecraft into space, deliver humans and cargo to the <span calss="place moon">moon</span> and possibly <span calss="place mars">Mars</span>, and also launch planetary spacecraft, like missions to <span calss="place mars">Mars</span> or to Europa, into faster trajectories,</q> says <span class="person shindell">Matthew Shindell</span>, planetary science and exploration curator at the <span class="institution smithsonians">Shindell</span>.
</p>

<p>
But cargo aside, <span class="person musk">Musk</span> maintains that his company’s ultimate purpose is to make the human species multiplanetary. Starship is the metallic embodiment of that wild ambition. <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> aspires to eventually build and operate a thousand Starships, some ferrying supplies and people to <span calss="place mars">Mars</span>.
</p>

<p>
What was once a passion project for <span class="person musk">Musk</span> has impressed <span calss="institution nasa">NASA</span> enough to include Starship as one of three vehicles being considered to land astronauts on the <span calss="place moon">moon</span>. The <span class="institution USmilitary">U.S. military</span> is also considering using the rocket to fly cargo to various locations around the planet.
</p>

<p>
The company has come a long way since its founding in <span class="date 2002">2002</span>. Under the steady guidance of president <span class="person shotwell">Gwynne Shotwell</span>, <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> recaptured the <span class="institution USCSLM">U.S. commercial satellite launch market</span>, launching payloads on its successful Falcon 9 rocket, which recently flew for the 100th time. It began lofting cargo to the <span class="place ISS">International Space Station</span> for <span calss="institution nasa">NASA</span> in <span class="date 2012">2012</span>, and national security satellites for the military in <span class="date 2018">2018</span>. Earlier this year, <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> became the first company in history to launch humans.
</p>

<p>
<span class="person shotwell">Shotwell</span> is responsible for turning <span class="person musk">Musk</span>’s lofty goals into realities. <q class="quote">When <span class="person musk">Elon </span>says something, you have to pause and not immediately blurt out, Well, that's impossible,</q> she said during a <span class="event TED-2018"><span class="date 2018">2018</span> TED talk</span>. <q class="quote">So, you zip it and you think about it, and you find ways to get that done.</q>
</p>

<p>
Along the way, <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> has attracted a passionate fan base inspired by its multiplanetary ambitions. <q class="quote">This vision of putting humans on <span calss="place mars">Mars</span> seems far-fetched, and it may never materialize, but it does seem to be a source of morale within <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> and an aspect of <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>’s public identity,</q> <span class="person shindell">Shindell</span> says. <q class="quote">They are selling launch services, but they’re also selling images and ideas of the future.</q>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Spaceport <span class="place BC">Boca Chica</span></h2>
The unlikely launchpad for these science fiction dreams is <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Beach, 20 miles outside <span class="place brownsville">Brownsville</span></span>, tucked between national wildlife refuges and the <span class="place TMborder">Texas-Mexico border</span>. It’s on the way to nowhere—a long ride from <span class="place brownsville">Brownsville</span> along Route 4 dead-ends at the public beach, the road literally running into sand. Ridley’s sea turtles, ocelots, and scores of birds inhabit the refuges that dot this undeveloped coastline.
</p>

<p>
The human residents mostly live in what’s called <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Village</span>, an unincorporated hamlet that, at its peak, had about 30 homes and trailers in and around its unofficial borders. Water wells and septic tanks replace public utilities at this remote outpost.
</p>

<p>
<span class="person stevens">Cheryl Stevens</span> grew up in <span class="place brownsville">Brownsville</span>, and her family considered the isolated beach their best kept secret for four generations. She rented out her beach home and planned to retire there. She was never put off by <span class="place BC">Boca Chica</span>’s lack of infrastructure, such as the absence of streetlights and garbage trucks. <q class="quote">Even in <span class="place brownsville">Brownsville</span>, people don’t know <span class="place BC">Boca Chica</span> or ever come out here. You have to go out of your way to find it,</q> she says.
</p>

<p>
But <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> saw <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Beach</span> as a possible spaceport for the future. The location has some key advantages for launching rockets: very few people live nearby, a large body of water where rockets can safely fall, and the proximity to the Equator means the spin of <span calss="place earth">Earth</span> provides an extra boost into space.
</p>

<p>
Even <span calss="institution nasa">NASA</span> had considered the area for its main launch center in the <span class="date 1960s">1960s</span>, but it chose <span class="place FL">Florida</span> instead because the swampland where <span class="place KS">Kennedy Space Center</span> now sits was considered more remote—and because the <span class="institution USG">U.S. government</span> in <span class="event crash-1947>"<span class="date 1947">1947</span> accidentally crashed an experimental ballistic rocket in <span class="place MX">Mexico</span></span>, causing a diplomatic incident. Now <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> has single-handedly brought the dream of a launch site back to the border
</p>

<img src="assets/NG3.png" style="height:500px; width:auto;">

<p>
The company, which spent 15 years as a startup fighting for survival against aerospace giants such as <span class="institution boeing">Boeing</span> and <span class="institution LM">Lockheed Martin</span>, has now taken <span calss="place earth">Earth</span>’s orbit by storm. <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> launches cargo and crew to the <span class="place ISS">International Space Station</span> for <span calss="institution nasa">NASA</span> as well as lofting dozens of civilian and military satellites for customers around the world each year.
</p>

<p>
In <span class="date 2014">2014</span>, after quietly buying up tracts of land, <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> announced <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Beach</span> as the location for its test and flight facility, with <span class="place texas">Texas</span> contributing $15 million for county infrastructure. The company started bringing tons of dirt to stabilize the ground under what would become a launch pad. But in <span class="date 2016">2016</span>, as <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> focused on launching astronauts for <span calss="institution nasa">NASA</span>, the work stopped. The only thing that identified the beach as the location of the most audacious project in aerospace history was a mound of dirt and a metal sign reading, <q class="quote"><span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> <span class="place texas">South Texas Launch Site</span>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then in <span class="date 2017">2017</span> the concrete trucks appeared to lay the foundation. A manufacturing facility sprouted up, where metalworkers stacked stainless steel hulls for Starship prototypes. When the launchpad was finished, a steady convoy of trucks rumbled down the now-battered Route 4 with tanks of oxygen and methane to power the rockets.
</p>

<p>
When <span class"event raptorTest"><span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> started testing its Raptor rocket engine in <span class="date 2018">2018</span></span>, paper fliers appeared on village doors announcing the shutting of Route 4 during ignitions. The closures often lasted all day, sometimes several times a week. Residents couldn’t get past roadblocks without proving they lived there, as if <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> controlled the county—but the lines were blurred, considering off-duty sheriff’s deputies work as company security at the launch site, <span class="person stevens">Stevens</span> says.
</p>

<p>
<span class="event SX offering"> In <span class="date 2019"> September 2019</span>, <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> sent a letter to the handful of homeowners in <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Village</span>, offering to buy their land for three times the appraisal value.</span> The homeowners spoke to an attorney who advised them to sell, since the county could use eminent domain to remove them on <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>’s behalf. This prompted most owners to take the deal, albeit after negotiating for better terms than the letter offered.
</p>

<p>
<q class="quote">It seemed like the writing was on the wall,</q> <span class="person stevens">Stevens</span> says. She signed her land over in  <span class="date 2019">October 2019</span> at a profit but regards accepting the payout as a surrender of her family’s grounds. <q class="quote">It’s not about the money,</q> she says. <q class="quote">It doesn’t make up for what I’ve lost, and my family’s lost.</q>
</p>

<p>
The full-time population at <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Village</span> now numbers six, which doubles with seasonal occupants. <span class="person stevens">Stevens</span> estimates there are 10 landowners that have not sold to <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>. She calls them her <q class="quote">feisty neighbors</q> and expects they will never sell willingly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="event SN8flight"> During the SN8 flight</span>, the village residents were relocated to a hotel on nearby <span class="place southpadre">South Padre Island</span> to watch in safety.
</p>

<p>
<h2>A superheavy rocket</h2>
Even as the charred remains of SN8 sit on the landing pad, workers inside <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>’s <span class="place BC">Boca Chica</span> factory are assembling 30-foot-wide sections for an even larger rocket: a 230-foot-tall behemoth called SuperHeavy. This giant booster, known as a first stage, is planned to launch with Starship, which will then separate to cruise to other planets and land on its own. When finished, the Starship and SuperHeavy combo will stand 395 feet tall, bigger than the largest rocket ever built: the Apollo-era Saturn V that took astronauts to the <span calss="place moon">moon</span>.
</p>

<p>
Behind the ambitious program, <span class="person musk">Musk</span> has become a polarizing character for his personal and business lives. The <span class="institution SEC">SEC</span> fined him after he erroneously tweeted about taking <span class="institution tesla">Tesla</span> public in <span class="date 2018">2018</span>, and <span calss="institution nasa">NASA</span> conducted a workplace review of <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> after he smoked pot on a popular podcast. His love life, mood swings, treatment of employees, and erratic <span class="institution twitter">Twitter</span> posts attract enough attention that a <span class="institution VF">Vanity Fair</span> writer recently quipped, <q class="quote tweet">If we end up on <span calss="place mars">Mars</span>, <span class="person musk">Musk</span> will be there too, and he will bring his extremes with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
At the same time, <span class="person musk">Musk</span>’s fan base grows. Some spaceflight watchers around the world have lost faith in the traditional aerospace giants and big-ticket <span calss="institution nasa">NASA</span> programs, such as the Space Launch System rocket, delayed by years and running billions of dollars over its initial budget, according to the space agency’s Inspector General.
</p>

<p>
<span class="person greco">Tony Greco</span>, 52, and his 24-year-old son traveled from <span class="place HS">Houston</span> to watch <span class="event SN8flight"> SN8 fly</span>, working remotely from an RV in a <span class="place southpadre">South Padre </span>trailer park. <q class="quote">No one else is getting it done but <span class="person musk">Elon Musk</span>,</q> he said during a visit to the <span class="place BC"><span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> pad</span> the night before the launch. He then pointed to the Starship prototype. <q class="quote">That is the step, right there, to get us off the mud ball.</q>
</p>

<p>
<span class="person musk">Musk</span>’s net worth, measured at $28 billion in <span class="date 2019">2019</span>, rose by an astounding $100.3 billion in <span class="date 2020">2020</span>. Much of that growth can be attributed to <span class="institution tesla">Tesla</span>, now the most valuable car company in the world, but <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> has also achieved booming business thanks to some <span class0"event ASH">impressive achievements in rocketry—such as bringing orbital boosters back from space to land and relaunch again</span>, a first in aerospace history.
</p>

<p>
For all the talk about <span class="person musk">Musk</span>’s dream of <span calss="place mars">Mars</span>, Starship is attracting customers. The first was Japanese billionaire <span class="person maezawa">Yusaku Maezawa</span>, who paid an undisclosed amount to charter a ride around the <span calss="place moon">moon</span> with as many artists as the ship can hold. In June, <span calss="institution nasa">NASA</span> picked Starship as one of three lander designs that could carry astronauts to the lunar surface. More surprisingly, perhaps, the <span class="person headUSTC">head of the <span class="institution DDsUSTC">Defense Department’s U.S. Transportation Command</span></span>revealed that it is considering using Starship to make deliveries of military cargo across the globe in an hour.
</p>

<p>
Achieving a privately funded human landing on <span calss="place mars">Mars</span> may not be feasible by <span class="person musk">Musk</span>’s proposed date in <span class="date 2026">2026</span>, but that doesn’t mean Starship can’t be profitable. <q class="quote"><span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> can potentially find customers here in the <span class="place US">U.S</span>, or internationally, who want to send heavy things into space or send spacecraft on faster journeys to the outer planets,</q> <span class="person shindell">Shindell</span> says. <q class="quote">So there is potentially a lot of money to be made on the way to <span calss="place mars">Mars</span>, so to speak.</q>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Rocket tests and wildlife preserves</h2>
The rapid progress with Starship and the coming SuperHeavy booster bodes well for <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>’s interplanetary dreams, but others are concerned about the impact the colossal rocket tests will have on <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Beach</span>.
</p>

<p>
Damage has already been done. <span class="event accident-2019"In <span class="date 2019">July 2019</span>, a rocket test sparked a fire in <span class="place BC">Boca Chica</span> State Park, quickly spreading across more than 10 acres</span>. The <span class="institution USFWS">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)</span> filed a complaint, stating that it <q class="quote">was not notified until the next day and by that time, the fire was smoldering and flared up and had burned approximately 130 to 135 acres more.</q> Another fire later that year went unfought for three hours because firefighters could not enter the area for fear of inhaling methane fumes.
</p>

<p>
Fires like these during <span class="event migrationSeason">bird migrations or turtle nesting seasons</span> could be devastating. The <span class="institution USFWS">USFWS</span> noted to the <span class="institution FAA">Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)</span> in <span class="date 2019">November 2019</span>: <q class="quote"><span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> should strive to avoid or reduce the number of testing/launches between  <span class="event migrationSeason">March 15 and August 15</span> to avoid disturbance to nesting sea turtles and shorebirds that utilize refuge areas immediately adjacent to the <span class="place BC">launch site</span>.</q>
</p>

<p>
The <span class="institution FAA">FAA</span>’s response did not encourage environmentalists: <q class="quote"><span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> is currently avoiding Starship testing and launches during migratory bird and sea turtle nesting seasons. However, some testing and launches might occur during this period.</q> It added that the company was open to <q class="quote">establish compensation for Refuge damages caused by <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> anomalies.</q>
</p>

<p>
In mid-November, <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> invited representatives from two local environmentalist groups to visit their facilities. <q class="quote">This was a first-time thing,</q> says meeting attendee <span class="person chapman">Jim Chapman</span>, the president of <span class="institution FWC">Friends of the Wildlife Corridor</span>. The meeting was not contentious, but it didn’t start a dialogue. <q class="quote">I think <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> was trying to make nice,</q> <span class="person chapman">Chapman</span> says.
</p>

<p>
Until recently, the <span class="institution FAA">FAA</span> had maintained that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) conducted in <span class="date 2014">2014</span> covered <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>’s operations, despite the fact that the work had grown significantly in scale with the SuperHeavy project. But last month, just after the meeting with local environmentalists, the <span class="institution FAA">FAA</span> announced a more comprehensive EIS to examine <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>’s operations.
</p>

<p>
Instead of seeing this as welcome news, <span class="person chapman">Chapman</span> feels the <span class="institution FAA">FAA</span> is now protecting the company from legal challenges by bringing the environmental review under government auspices. <q class="quote">What <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> had to worry about was not necessarily the <span class="institution FAA">FAA</span>, which is almost a partner, but being taken to court,</q> <span class="person chapman">Chapman</span> says.
</p>

<p>
<span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> media representatives didn’t respond to questions about the environmental impact of its operations in <span class="place texas">South Texas</span>. But there may be a development that could ease the impact on the beach’s ecosystems in the future, even as <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> expands.
</p>

<p>
In <span class="date 2020">June 2020</span>, <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> posted a job opening in <span class="place brownsville">Brownsville</span> for <q class="quote">Offshore Operations Engineers</q> to <q class="quote">build an operational offshore rocket launch facility.</q> <span class="person musk">Musk</span> himself weighed in shortly after on <span class="institution twitter">Twitter</span>: <q class="quote tweet"><span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> is building floating, superheavy-class spaceports for <span calss="place mars">Mars</span>, <span calss="place moon">moon</span> & hypersonic travel around <span calss="place earth">Earth</span>.</q> Abandoned offshore oil derricks, visible from <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Beach</span>, are one possible location for a permanent <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> launchpad.
</p>

<p>
Offshore launch pads may ease the road closures and provide relief to nature. <q class="quote">The biggest impacts on wildlife are during tests and launches,</q> <span class="person chapman">Chapman</span> says. <q class="quote">So moving offshore would have less.</q>
</p>

<p>
But for now, all the action remains on the shore, including work on SuperHeavy. <span class="person chapman">Chapman</span> takes issue with the way <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> seemingly asks for regulator permission after they have already begun the work in question. <q class="quote">I mean, they don’t have permission to launch the big rocket [SuperHeavy], and it doesn’t seem to be slowing them down at all, does it?</q> he says.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Up from the ashes</h2>
<span class="event StarshipPremier">The world first saw the Starship design at <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Beach</span> during an invitation-only event in <span class="date 2019">October 2019</span></span>. The full-scale model, set up purely for show, could be seen for miles, attracting a crowd of beat journalists and supporters in a revival tent-like atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
After the sun went down, <span class="person musk">Musk</span> spoke to the attendees. <q class="quote">This thing is going to take off, fly to 20 kilometers, and come back and land, in about one or two months,</q> <span class="person musk">Musk</span> said over gusts of wind and applause. <q class="quote">That will be pretty epic, to see that thing take off and come back.</q>
</p>

<p>
He was a year and two months late, 7.5 kilometers too low, and one landing short, but Starship is now flying—and dying—on <span class="place BC">Boca Chica Beach</span>. From this point on, the community is a flight test center. Judging by the hundreds of people who lined the shoreline of nearby <span class="place southpadre">South Padre Island</span> during the <span class="event SN8flight">SN8 flight, it’s also the birth of space tourism in <span class="place texas">South Texas</span></span>. The handful of locals have been replaced by a horde of visitors.
</p>

<p>
<q class="quote">It’s impossible to predict whether or not <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> will succeed in the short- or long-term with Starship,</q> <span class="person shindell">Shindell</span> says. <q class="quote">But their activities seem to have inspired a good amount of public confidence, good will, and enthusiasm for space exploration.</q>
</p>

<p>
The work continues. Up the road from the remains of SN8, SN9 is already assembled and ready for action, waiting inside a hangar for its turn on the pad. An assembly line of Starship prototypes will follow. <span class="event earth-mars-alignement">About every two years, the planets align to enable the fastest possible flight between <span calss="place earth">Earth</span> and <span calss="place mars">Mars</span></span>—and <span class="person musk">Elon Musk</span> wants to be ready.
