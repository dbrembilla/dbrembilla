<p>
There’s an emerging industry thought to be only science fiction not too long ago that’s close to becoming a reality: space tourism. 
</p>

<p>
And a handful of companies – including one publicly traded name – are competing neck and neck to be leaders in the emerging market.
</p>

<p>
But what space tourism entails, and how much it costs per person, varies greatly depending on a company’s technological capabilities.  For example, both <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> and <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> expect to fly private paying passengers to space next year. But, while passengers flying with both companies would go to space by the <span class="institution FAA">Federal Aviation Administration</span>’s definition, a <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> passenger spends about 0.04% as much time in space as on a <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> trip, while a ride with <span class="person musk">Elon Musk</span>’s company is expected to cost roughly 200 times as much.

But what space tourism entails, and how much it costs per person, varies greatly depending on a company’s technological capabilities.  For example, both <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> and <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> expect to fly private paying passengers to space next year.

</p>

<p>
Whether a passenger reaches suborbital and orbital space is the major difference in the destinations of the human spaceflight offerings in development. Because of that difference, there are notable distinctions in the cost, experience and even risk of what it means to be a space tourist.
</p>

<p>
<span class="institution UBS">UBS</span> in a report last year estimated that space tourism, with both suborbital and orbital together, has a potential market value of $3 billion by <span class="date 2030">2030</span>. More recently, space industry consultancy <span class="institution NSR">Northern Sky Research</span> broke out its expectations for suborbital versus orbital tourism. By <span class="date 2028">2028</span>, <span class="institution NSR">NSR</span> expects suborbital will be a $2.8 billion market, with $10.4 billion in total revenue over the next decade, while orbital will be a $610 million market, with $3.6 billion in total revenue over the next decade.
</p>

<p>
Here’s how the small but growing market breaks down, and which companies are involved in each area.
</p>


<h2>Suborbital tourism</h2>

<p>
There are two companies competing in the realm of suborbital tourism: <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span>, which debuted on the public market last year and trades under the ticker <q class="quote">SPCE,</q> and <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>, the private space company funded almost entirely by <span class="institution amazon">Amazon</span> founder <span class="person bezos">Jeff Bezos</span>.
</p>

<p>
Both of the companies’ systems are rocket-powered and capable of carrying up to six passengers on a flight, but that is where the similarities end.
</p>

<p>
<span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span>’s spacecraft SpaceShipTwo, which has two pilots in addition to the passengers, is docked underneath a jet-powered carrier aircraft known as WhiteKnightTwo. With the spacecraft attached, the carrier aircraft takes off from a runway and climbs to an altitude of more than 40,000 feet. Then the spacecraft is dropped, free-falling briefly before firing its rocket motor and ascending to an altitude of about 295,000 feet, or roughly 90 kilometers. The spacecraft essentially does a slow back flip at the edge of space, with passengers spending a few minutes floating in microgravity, before it re-enters and then glides back to land on its runway in <span class="place NM">New Mexico</span>. The company reuses the spacecraft, replacing the hybrid rocket engine and reconnecting it to the carrier aircraft.
</p>

<p>
<span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>’s more traditional rocket New Shepard launches with a domed capsule on top of the about 60 foot tall booster. It ascends straight up, with the capsule separating near the top of the flight and reaching an altitude of more than 330,000 feet, or about 100 kilometers. There the capsule floats for a few minutes in microgravity before returning back to <span class="place earth">Earth</span>, slowing down using a system of parachutes to land in the <span class="place TX">West Texas</span> desert floor.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
But unlike conventional rockets, New Shepard’s booster also comes back to land separately – with the company reusing the boosters for future launches.

<p>
<span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> has sold about tickets to about 600 passengers at a price between $200,000 and $250,000 each, although the company expects it could increase its prices substantially for the first commercial flights. <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> has said its ticket pricing is yet to be determined, but <span class="person bezos"> Bezos</span> expects his company will price flights on New Shepard comparable to competitors. 
</p>

<p>
To date <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> has flown five people to space on two test flights. All five are company employees, with four pilots controlling the spacecraft and chief astronaut trainer Beth Moses riding along as a test passenger on the second flight. The company expects to conduct two more test spaceflights before it flies founder <span class="person branson">Richard Branson</span>, which is planned for the first quarter of <span class="date 2021">2021</span> and will effectively mark the beginning of <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span>’s commercial service. <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>, on the other hand, has yet to fly passengers on New Shepard despite completing 12 missions in the past few years. The company’s CEO <span class="person smith">Bob Smith</span> earlier this year said New Shepard will need to fly three or four more test flights before <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> puts people on board.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> has said that passengers will spend three days training before a flight, while <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> expects its passengers will train for just one day. 
</p>

<p>
Given the price point of the flights, both <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> and <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> are targeting high net worth individuals for the suborbital experiences. <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> chief space officer <span class="person whitesides">George Whitesides</span> has previously categorized space tourism flights as an <q class="quote">out-of-home luxury experience,</q> which is the fastest-growing part of the luxury market. And, when <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span> also begins flying passengers, <span class="person whitesides">Whitesides</span> said he thinks both companies will have more than enough demand for flights.
</p>

<p>
<q class="quote">Globally, we think around 2 million people can experience this over the coming years at this price point. Over time, we’ll be able to reduce that price point and at that point the market just explodes. It’s 10 times as many at 40 million people,</q> <span class="person whitesides">Whitesides</span> said last year.
</p>

<p>
<span class="institution cowen">Cowen</span> and <span class="institution UBS">UBS</span> have each recently conducted surveys of high net worth individuals and their interest in suborbital tourism. <span class="institution cowen">Cowen</span>’s survey exceeded <span class="person whitesides">Whitesides</span>’ estimation, as the firm found suborbital flights have a total addressable market of about 2.4 million people among individuals with a net worth of more than $5 million. <span class="institution UBS">UBS</span> surveyed more than 6,000 high net worth individuals specifically on flying with <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span>. About 20% of those <span class="institution UBS">UBS</span> surveyed said they are <q class="quote">likely to purchase a ticket on a spacecraft within 1 year</q> of the company beginning regular flights. That number increases to between more than 35% <q class="quote">after several years of safe operation,</q> <span class="institution UBS">UBS</span> said.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, <span class="institution UBS">UBS</span> highlighted how much <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span>’s space tourism market expands as the price comes down. The firm estimated that there are about 1.78 million people with a net worth of more than $10 million but there are about twice that many with a net worth between $5 million and $10 million – and about 37.1 million people with a net worth between $1 million and $5 million.
</p>

<h2>Orbital tourism</h2>
<figure><img src="assets/cnbc6.jpeg" style="height:300px; width:auto;">
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Unlike suborbital, which reaches an altitude of about 100 kilometers (or 330,000 feet) and gives passengers a few minutes in space, orbital missions reach an altitude of over 400 kilometers (or 1.3 million feet) and spend days or even more than a week in space. To date, orbital space tourism has largely been limited to a few flights to the <span class="institution ISS">International Space Station</span> that used Russian Soyuz spacecraft.
</p>

<p>
But <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>, with its Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule, has now entered the orbital tourism arena. This summer <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> launched and returned two <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span> astronauts with its spacecraft for the first time ever, in a mission that was historic for both <span class="person musk">Musk</span>’s company and the <span class="institution USSA"><span class="place USA">U.S.</span> space agency</span>. The test flight made <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> the first private company to send people to orbit, a feat only previously achieved by government superpowers.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> launch system is similar to <span class="institution BO">Blue Origin</span>’s, but with a more powerful rocket and a larger capsule. Its Crew Dragon spacecraft is built to hold as many as seven passengers and sits on top of the company’s 230 foot tall Falcon 9 rocket booster. Launching from <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span>’s Kennedy Space Center in <span class="place FL">Florida</span>, it takes the spacecraft several hours to reach either the <span class="institution ISS">ISS</span> or its intended orbit. <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span> astronauts on the recent <span class="event mission1">Demo-2 mission</span> described riding in <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>’s capsule as <q class="quote">a little bit smoother</q> than the Space Shuttles of the past, which were <q class="quote">a little bit rougher, at least at the beginning.</q>
</p>
<figure><img src="assets/cnbc7.jpeg" style="height:300px; width:auto;">
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Even before that <span class="event mission1">Demo-2 mission</span> launched, <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> had already signed two separate agreements with companies looking to fly private paying passengers to space. While <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span>’s astronauts spend months up at the <span class="institution ISS">ISS</span>, the private missions will be only about 10 days at most. While <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> hasn’t disclosed specifically how much each of the current contracts are worth, previously announced contracts mean that it will likely cost about $50 million per person to fly with Crew Dragon.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the launch costs, a 10-day mission to the <span class="institution ISS">ISS</span> would rack up a $350,000 bill with <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span>. Under the agency’s cost structure unveiled last year, <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span> would get $35,000 a night per person, as compensation for the agency’s services a tourist would need while on board the <span class="institution ISS">ISS</span>.
</p>

<p>
But Crew Dragon likely won’t be the only option for private passengers to get to the <span class="institution ISS">ISS</span> in the coming years. While testing delays mean the spacecraft remains in development, <span class="institution boeing">Boeing</span>’s Starliner capsule is also designed to carry as many as seven passengers. And, under <span class="institution boeing">Boeing</span>’s contract with <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span> to fly four astronauts at a time, the company is allowed to sell the fifth seat to prospective space tourists. A <span class="institution boeing">Boeing</span> spokesperson told <span class="institution CNBC">CNBC</span> on Friday that the company has a team actively looking to sell that fifth seat.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Finally, Crew Dragon and Starliner are likely to remain the two best options for orbital tourists, <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> is also working on its next-generation Starship rocket. It’s the company’s top priority, as <span class="person musk">Musk</span> wants to build a fully reusable rocket system that can launch cargo or as many as 100 people at a time. But, while <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> has signed a deal to fly Japanese billionaire <span class="person maezawa">Yusaku Maezawa</span> around the <span class="place moon">moon</span> with Starship in <span class="date 2023">2023</span>, <span class="person musk">Musk</span> noted earlier this month that the rocket will have to complete <q class="quote">hundreds of missions with satellites before we put people on board.</q>

<p>
Starship prototypes have launched and landed in short flight tests this past year but the rocket has yet to reach orbit. 
</p>

<h2>Orbital brokers and services</h2>
<p>
In addition to the handful of companies building rockets and spacecraft that fly people, there are a few that also help find interested passengers and get them ready to launch. <span class="institution SA">Space Adventures</span>,<span class="institution AS">Axiom Space</span> and <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> each offer some variation of orbital space tourism services, although the companies don’t build or launch spacecraft that go to orbit.
</p>

<p>
Over the past two decades <span class="place USA">U.S.</span>-based <span class="institution SA">Space Adventures</span> has flown seven tourists using Russian spacecraft. At a reported cost of more than $20 million per person, the private clients typically spent over a week on board the the <span class="institution ISS">ISS</span>. Most recently, <span class="institution SA">Space Adventures</span> signed one of the two deals announced with <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>. Using a Crew Dragon capsule, <span class="institution SA">Space Adventures</span> plans to have <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span> fly four tourists on a <q class="quote">free-flyer</q> mission to orbit, meaning they won’t dock with the <span class="institution ISS">ISS</span> but instead will orbit the <span class="place earth">Earth</span> for five days before returning. The mission is expected to launch between <q class="quote">late-<span class="date 2021">2021</span> to <span class="date 2011">mid-2022</span>,</q> with <span class="institution SA">Space Adventures</span> saying that training would take <q class="quote">a few weeks.</q>
</p>
<figure><img src="assets/cnbc10.jpeg" style="height:300px; width:auto;">
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
<span class="place TX">Houston</span>-based start-up<span class="institution AS">Axiom Space</span> signed the other deal with <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>, to fly a professionally-trained commander and three passengers to the <span class="institution ISS">ISS</span> in October <span class="date 2021">2021</span> using Crew Dragon. It will be a 10 day mission, with two days of travel and eight days on board the space station. In this case <span class="institution AS">Axiom</span> acts as more than just a broker, providing all the services necessary – from training to management and more.
</p>

<p>
While <span class="institution AS">Axiom</span> has not confirmed who the members of the crew will be, <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span> in <span class="date 2020">May</span> announced that it is working with actor <span class="person cruise">Tom Cruise</span> to film a movie on the <span class="institution ISS">ISS</span>. And, while the agency did not confirm <span class="person cruise">Cruise</span> is flying with <span class="institution AS">Axiom</span> or <span class="institution spaceX">SpaceX</span>, <span class="person musk">Musk</span> tweeted that the mission <q class="quote">should be a lot of fun!</q> On Wednesday, space industry publication <span class="institution SN">Spaceflight Now</span> reported that <span class="person cruise">Cruise</span> will be one of the passengers on an <span class="institution AS">Axiom</span> mission.
</p>

<p>
<span class="institution AS">Axiom</span> also confirmed this month that it is working with a <span class="place USA">U.S.</span> television production company called <span class="institution SH">Space Hero</span> for another 10 day trip to the <span class="institution ISS">ISS</span>. Scheduled for <span class="date 2023">2023</span>, <span class="institution SH">Space Hero</span> said it plans send the winning contestant of a reality TV show to the space station, with <span class="institution AS">Axiom</span> training the crew and managing the mission.
</p>

<p>
Finally, while <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> doesn’t plan to develop an orbital spacecraft, the company signed an agreement with <span class="institution NASA">NASA</span> that sets the company <q class="quote">up to become a player in the provision of that service,</q> it said. Since signing the agreement, <span class="institution VG">Virgin Galactic</span> said it now has <q class="quote">deposit agreements</q> for orbital spaceflights with 12 customers, although it has yet to finalize pricing.
</p>

<p>
<q class="quote">We expect pricing to be competitive with other offerings in the market,</q> <span class="person whitesides">Whitesides</span> told investors during the company’s most recent quarterly earnings call.
